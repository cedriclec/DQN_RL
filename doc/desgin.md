#Proposal project

Implement an **artificial intelligence** able to learn by itself how to learn a new game using **reinforcement learning**. 
This project is based on the paper [_Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning_.](https://scholar.google.co.kr/scholar?q=Playing+Atari+with+Deep+Reinforcement+Learning&hl=fr&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiRkP_v_qvXAhVHS7wKHWuKCHYQgQMIIzAA)

##First step
The first step of this project, which enables me to practice **Reinforcement Learning**, will be to implement an AI for 2 games with only two actions : *Cart-Pole*. 
To make it easier I will provide to the model

* Actions
* Observations
* Reward

This informations are provided by the environnment [**GYM**](https://gym.openai.com/docs/)

###Deep Q Learning
Deep-Q-Learning is an algorithm which enables me to implement this solution
