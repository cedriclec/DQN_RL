#Diffrent input shape for each geame

##Breakout 
Observation = [210, 160, 3] => 100800
            => RGB, convert it to grey =>
Observation => [210, 160] => 33600 (Convert it into 1D array for input as neural network) 

!! In code, they found than observation => 84 84 (with grey value)

Action = Discrete(4) =>
Reward = [] =>
